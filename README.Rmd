remBoot is an implementation of the Random Encounter Model (REM) developed by Rowcliffe _et al._ (2008). The REM is based on brownian motion and allows the estimation of animal densities for a given survey area. The REM is particularly useful in that species do not need to be marked or exhibit individual markings for estimates to be calculated. This package contains a number of functions which allow the user to calculate densities for one or more sites and bootstrap their data to calculate variance.   

The package was updated on th 9th of April 2019 to generate four measures of variance: standard deviation; standard error; 95% confidence intervals; quantiles.

# Installation

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("arcaravaggi/remBoot")
```

# Example

```{r EG}
library(remBoot)

data(hDat)  
grpDat <- split_dat(hDat)  
tm <- 3600  
v <- 1.4  
rem(dat = grpDat[[1]], tm = 3600, v = 1.4)  
rem(dat = grpDat[[2]], tm = 3360, v = 1.4)  

nboots <- 1000  
remsD <- lapply(grpDat, boot_sd)   
remsSD <- lapply(remsD, sd)  
remsSD  
```
